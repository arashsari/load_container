# load_container

For a given collection of container sizes and a required load, write an algorithm
(simple console app will suffice), that will select sufficient containers for
the load, such that:

1. the overcapacity is minimized, and
2. the smallest number of containers are used

Finding a set containers from container list to fullfill requested load
`containers` is a a tuple or list of numbers separated by comma.
This varibale filled by getting values from input command.
'load' is just a number
Return would be a list of numbers in container that are
either equal or with minimum of extra space to fill the requestedload.
